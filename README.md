# extraction JWST cube

PLEASE INSTALL ASTROCONDA FOR RUNNING THIS CODE

The code extracts the spectra from a cube of MIRI and NIRspec. A bigger summary is shown in the code itself (notebook standard).
Along with the code you can find a simulation fo the Great Red Spot of Jupiter made with MIRIsim (Q branch of methane around 7.7 microns). A brief summary of the process I followed to create it is in the directory of the data.

There are still things to add (lat and lon format in the cube itself) and things to check (shift in wavelength and oversize of the PSF) that will be solved when the real data will arrive.
